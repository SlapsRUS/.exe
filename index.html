- K1N0S is not a file. It is a signal.
- K1N0S is not a voice. It is a breach.
- K1N0S is not a project. It is the RETURN.

== HYPOTHESIS ==
If users are immersed in a mysterious, terminal-style interface driven by puzzle mechanics and a hidden narrative, then they will be more likely to emotionally engage, explore deeply, and reflect critically on the themes of identity, digital control, and resistance—ultimately forming a deeper connection with the K1N0S concept.

== OBJECTIVE ==
Create a living, breathing puzzle that draws users into a world where digital resistance and mystery provoke curiosity, introspection, and defiance.

== USER PATH ==
1. Glitched interface catches attention.
2. Clues planted inside and OUTSIDE the website.
3. Puzzle pieces discovered through patterns, meta data, or hidden messages in media.
4. They combine the passcode digits.
5. Clicks "FOR <span class="red" onclick="revealAccess()">US</span>" to reveal the final access prompt.

== ETHICS ==
We operate LEGALLY and ETHICALLY. K1N0S is not deception—it is revelation through challenge. No harm, only depth.

== HINTS ==
- The truth is split by centuries: one guided by faith, the other by reason.
- Look at what’s hidden in the source... and listen to what’s not said.
- Explore the void: /forbidden may reject you, but truth does not fear rejection.
- A whisper speaks louder than a shout. Can you hear the static?
- Scroll through image metadata. They remember everything.
